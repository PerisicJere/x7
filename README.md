# x7
### Exercises
- Question 4 is found in x7/x7.pdf
- Question 5,8 and 14 are inside x7 directory
- Question 7 is the first graph in the graphs variable of kruskal.py.
```bash
cd x7
```
### Generate graphs
- This will generate file with MST graphs, declare number of nodes and probability of connection. 
- Example:
```bash
python main.py 5 0.7 randomGraph.pdf
```
## Prim's 
### Run
```bash
python3 prims.py
```
![Graph with MST 1](images/graphPrims1.png)
![Graph with MST 2](images/graphPrims2.png)

## Kruskals
### Run
```bash
python3 kruskals.py
```
![Graph with MST 3](images/graphKruskal1.png)
![Graph with MST 4](images/graphKruskal2.png)

## Dijkstra 
### Run
```bash
python3 dijkstra.py
```
![Graph with shortest path 1 ](images/graphDijkstra1.png)
![Graph with shortest path 2](images/graphDijkstra2.png)
